        "A chatbot is a software application that simulates human conversation using text or voice. The first chatbot, ELIZA, was created by Joseph Weizenbaum in the 1960s. Chatbots utilize natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI) to understand user queries and provide responses. They are used in customer service to offer instant support and improve efficiency. Benefits include 24/7 availability and the ability to handle multiple inquiries. Challenges include understanding user intent and managing complex interactions. As technology advances, chatbots are expected to become more personalized and integrated with other digital tools, enhancing user experience in various applications."
